Enter a password into the command line. 
The password must be between 8 and 16 characters. If it is not, the program will output, “Please enter a valid password length.”
The password must satisfy three of the four conditions:
It must contain an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, a digit, or one or more of the following special characters: "~!@#$%^&**()-“. 
If the password does not satisfy these conditions, the program will output, “Invalid password.” If the password satisfies those conditions and is a correct length, the program will output, “Valid password."
